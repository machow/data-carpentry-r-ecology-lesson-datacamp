## Importing your data and first views

In this exercises, you'll import your ecological dataset. After doing so, you'll check out the first rows using the function `head()`. Make sure to read the information that this function call outputs to your console to get a first idea of ehat your data looks like. Happy importing!

*** =instructions
- Download the file from `"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"` to the location `"data/portal_data_joined.csv"`.
- Import the file from your local file system to a dataframe called `surveys`.
- Check out the first 5 rows of your data using the function `head()`.

## Inspecting data.frame objects

In the previous exercise, you checked out your data by using the function `head()` to display the first five rows of your data. Here you'll use `str()` to dive deeper into the dataset, which is already loaded into `surveys`. In the console provided, use `str()` on `surveys`, check out the output and answer the following questions: what is the class of the object `surveys`? How many rows and how many columns are in this object? How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

[HBA] TBD: incorrect solutions [/HBA]


*** =instructions
- `surveys` is of class `data.frame`, has 13 rows, 34,786 columns and 40 species have been recorded.
- `surveys` is of class `record_id`, has 13 rows, 34,786 columns and 40 species have been recorded.
- `surveys` is of class `data.frame`, has 34,786 rows,  columns and 40 species have been recorded.
- `surveys` is of class `data.frame`, has 34,786 rows,  columns and 26 species have been recorded.

## Data.frame challenge (1)


*** =instructions

* Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the observations from row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_3707/datasets/combined.csv")
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

```

*** =solution
```{r}
surveys_200 <- surveys[200,]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object('surveys_200')
```

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1 key:3c3adfdbd5
## Data.frame challenge (2)

Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame?

*** =instructions

* Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame
* Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.
* Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number
* Create a new data frame object (`surveys_last`) from that last row


*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_3707/datasets/combined.csv")
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# use last row number to get last row


# use tail to get last row


# use nrow to pull out last row directly


# create new object (surveys_last) from last row

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# use last row number to get last row
surveys[34786,]

# use tail to get last row
tail(surveys, 1)

# use nrow to pull out last row directly
surveys[nrow(surveys),]

# create new object (surveys_last) from last row
surveys_last <- surveys[34786,]

```

*** =sct
```{r}
# MC-Note: this test might not be very robust
test_student_typed('surveys[34786,]')

test_function_v2('tail', args = c('x', 'n'))

# MC-Note: this test might not be very robust
test_student_typed('surveys[nrow(surveys),]')

test_object('surveys_last')
```

## Data.frame challenge (3)


*** =instructions

* Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_3707/datasets/combined.csv")
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

```

*** =solution
```{r}
n_middle <- nrow(surveys) / 2
surveys_middle <- surveys[n_middle, ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function_v2('nrow')
test_object('surveys_middle', incorrect_msg = 'Did you use `nrow(surveys) / 2` to find the index of the middle row?')
```

## Data.frame challenge (4)

[MC] could break this exercise into smaller steps [/MC]

Recall that `-` can be used to exclude rows.

For example, 

```
surveys[-c(1:5),]
```

returns all but the first 5 rows of `surveys`.

*** =instructions

* Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)` keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.
* Store the content of your new `data.frame` as surveys_first

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_3707/datasets/combined.csv")
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

```

*** =solution
```{r}
surveys_first <- surveys[-c(6:nrow(surveys)), ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
# makes sure they used nrow (but doesn't check how they used it)
test_function_v2('nrow')
# makes sure they typed a minus sign somewhere
test_student_typed('-')

test_object('surveys_first')
```
